The word network means a connection of objects, be it machines, humans, or any other living and non-living object.

***In Computers, a Network means the connection of devices. It can be from 2 devices to trillions of devices.***

**The Wikipedia definition of a computer network is**

> A set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

## **What are the types of computer network architecture?**

Computer network architecture can be divided into 2 categories:

### 1\. Client-server architecture

Before deep diving into Client-server architecture, we should know about what client and server mean in computer networking

> #### 1\. Client
> 
> Client is any device connected in the network which uses the service or accepts the information.
> 
> #### 2\. Server
> 
> A device that provides information and service to the client.

Client-server Architecture is an application/modal that breakdowns the workload between client and server, all requests and services are delivered over a network, and it is also referred to as the networking computing model or client-server network.

### 2\. Peer-to-peer architecture

In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, connected computers have equal powers and privileges. There is no central server for coordination. Each device in the computer network can act as either client or a server. Each device may share some of its resources, like memory and processing power, with the entire computer network.

### What is network Topology?

The arrangement of `nodes` and `links` is called network topology. They can be configured in different ways to get different outcomes. It's of many types which we will discuss in some other article.

> #### 1\. Nodes
> 
> The connection point among network devices such as routers, printers, or switches that can receive and send data from one endpoint to the other.
> 
> #### 2\. Links
> 
> link is a connection between the nodes, which can direct to another node. They point from one node to another.

### Types of Computer Networks

1.  Personal Area Network (PAN)
    
2.  Local Area Network (LAN)
    
3.  Wide Area Network (WAN)
    
4.  Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
    
5.  Campus Area Network (CAN)
    
6.  Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
    
7.  Storage Area Network (SAN)
    
8.  System-Area Network (SAN)
    
9.  Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)
    
10.  Enterprise Private Network (EPN)
    
11.  Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    
12.  Home Area Network (HAN)
