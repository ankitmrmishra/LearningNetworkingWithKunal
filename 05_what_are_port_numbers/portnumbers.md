Ports are a 16-BIT number which means we can have 16 cells and each cell can have Os And 1s, total numbers that can be generated are approx 65,000. When we request the internet for information and the internet sends back the information, it doesn't know where to send like to your webpage, your email, and other services from where information can be requested.

So the Internet decides which service to send with the help of Port Numbers e.g. Port number of HTTP is 80. Internet Checks this port number and sends the information back to the HTTP site.

## Common Port Numbers

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of Port Numbers

[From Wikipedia, we get Information about common port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)#Common_port_numbers)
