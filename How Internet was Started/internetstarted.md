After WW2, a cold war was going on between USA and Russia. Russia won the space race, the first to launch Sputnik-1 in 1957. The USA was constantly monitoring Russia(USSR at that time).

The USA planned to be first in some aspect, so they made an organization on Feb 7, 1958, **ARPA(Advanced Research Project Agency)** whose work was to make the USA first and advanced in every field and do scientific discoveries.

ARPA created a network between different computers which are at different geographical locations to share resources digitally which led to the **"INFORMATION REVOLUTION"** and the Birth Of the Internet.

Now, the problem occurring was that when they were sharing data and it has the link to the other resources it was inaccessible to the other computers connected to the network. Automated sharing was missing at that time. Here comes the WWW(World Wide Web)

WWW is a project which stores the document and where we can access the document. **The World's first website is** [**http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html**](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

### What is WWW (WORLD WIDE WEB)?

According to Wikipedia

> The **World Wide Web** (**WWW**), commonly known as the **Web**, is an [information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system) enabling documents and other [web resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource) to be accessed over the Internet. Documents and downloadable, media are made available to the network through [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) and can be accessed by programs such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called [uniform resource locators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (URLs). The original and still very common document type is a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) formatted in [Hypertext Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML).

### How far we came, from Web, web2 to web3.0.

*   WEB1 was all about reading, sharing, and fetching information
    
*   WEB2 evolved from reading, sharing, and fetching to creating, and interacting with the user.
    
*   WEB3.0 further moved forward to owing the internet or decentralization of the internet.
